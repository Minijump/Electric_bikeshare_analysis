## Foreword
We are in the midst of an ecological transition. Mobility represents a significant part of our CO2 emissions, and as such, changing the way we move ourselves will play a crucial role in the transition. While public transportation can solve some problems for longer trips, it does not always provide the flexibility required for efficient day-to-day transportation. That's where 'light vehicles' like bikes come in. A city's bike share network represents an affordable, accessible, and sustainable alternative to traditional transportation methods. By using bike share programs, people can reduce their carbon footprint and promote healthier, more active lifestyles.

## Goals
### MVP
The goal of this project is to provide a tool that would enable to analyse bike sharing network. This would enable the owners of the network to take measures in order to increase its efficiency.

### Technical goals
This project will enable me to train on __SQL__ and __Power BI__. 

Also I want this tool to be connected to a database in real time. Indeed, to be able to analyze the network the owners need to see the network state at each time. This will enable me to test the connection between Power BI and __Google BigQuerry__.

## Execution steps

* Get Data  __IN PROGRESS__
* Build a DataBase  __TODO__
* Create the Power BI dashboard  __TODO__

### Get Data
I will use the open data provided by Google BigQuerry on the BikeShare service of San Francisco(name of the database: bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare). You can also find more informations about this bikeshare service on the following link : https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/bike/bike-share.
